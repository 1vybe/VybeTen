VybeTen
-------

Pilot/concierge version of Vybe app on iOS aimed to be used by 10 people for sharing experiences in real time 

[TO DO]
- Release memory when entered in background
- Use CollectionView instead of TableView to list vybes
- Group vybes by day, week, and month
- Save location information when capturing vybes
- Remove Record button and create a subclass of UIView that responds to touch events and flicks when touched
- Setting opacity for a background view is heavy computation. Do something about this. 
- Use VYBImageStore and VYBVideoStore
- Generate buttons by code NOT by interface builder for LANDSCAPE mode
- Allow both landscape to be right AND left
- Instance variables vs. property? Performance issues
